another clone for HTML and CSS framework practicing (Bootstrap)

04/04/2020
Attempting to clone Newsweek as well as getting acquainted with css frameworks, specifically bootstrap for this project.
Going to be honest the lessons prior were real basic with framework details and didn't actually go into to much detail on how to use bootstrap or any quirks or like specific variables for it. Asked the Oden discord for recomendations for material for review, will need to find a reputable crash course so I have a better understanding on why, what and how to use bootstrap as well as other frameworks for the future.
